# arturo-personal-web2py
This repo is part of my web2py applications folder, and must be run within the applications repo in web2py in order
to get complete layout design.
The python scripting is used for the backend, and vuejs for front end, along with HTML, CSS, and bootstrap.
This repo is the first version of my personal website deployment, but it is no longer the current version.
